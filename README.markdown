# MoneyMoney extension for Uberspace.de accounts

This extension for [MoneyMoney](https://moneymoney-app.com/) retrieves
the balance and transactions from [Uberspace.de](https://uberspace.de/)
accounts.

## Login
Quick-fix: login for Uberspace accounts using an e-mail address for login is now possible. Username used in MoneyMoney should consist of two parts:
``user@domain.de|username`` where the first part is the e-mail address used for logging in to the Uberspace dashboard and the second part is the username used on the host (nicknamed "Asteroid").

Old accounts that still use username and password for login do not need to change the saved login credentials.

### Background
Since May 2024 it is possible to manage multiple Uberspace hosts under the same login credentials ([Announcement](https://blog.uberspace.de/2024/05/alle-unter-einem-dach/)).
